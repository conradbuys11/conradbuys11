<h1>Conrad Buys, Software Developer</h1>

<p>Hello! I'm Conrad, a developer with a passion for website & game design.

My favorite languages are Javascript & C#, and my favorite frameworks include React, Express.js, & Ruby on Rails.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Honing CSS skills & studying the philosophies of beautiful front-end design</li>
  <li>My own portfolio website</li>
